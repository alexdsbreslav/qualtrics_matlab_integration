# Integrating Qualtrics With Your Behavioral Example.
This is an explanation and toy example for how to integrate Qualtrics with you behavioral experiment. My behavioral experiment is written in MATLAB; however, this is relevant (and honestly easier) for those using Psychopy or other Python based experiment tools.

Requirements: 
- MATLAB 9.4
- MATLAB Toolbox: Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox 11.3
- A Qualtrics account
- Python3 with pandas and numpy

To run through the example:
- Import the two surveys into your Qualtrics survey library [click here for directions,https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/my-projects/creating-a-project/#CreatingFromAFile]
